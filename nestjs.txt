NEST JS

Nestfactory.create() is used too create NEST application instance
app.modules contains the implementation of the application root mdule
app.controller.ts is the controller file
app.servive.ts contains a basic service implementation
app.controller.spec.ts:Testing for controller

In the main.ts file we created the nestjs server with the help of nestjs/core library
and AppModule from app.module file 
which contains Appmodule with three three properties of Module decorator/library

these properties are imports,controller and providers
all three properties takes array of its kind like 
controller take all the controller which should be part of app module
provider : also know as service should be in this array



app.controller.ts
from the @nestjs/common library we import controller and Get
we initialize controller like this
@controller()
export class AppController{
constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}
	@Get()
	getHello(): string{
		return this.appService.getHello();
	}
}
